    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In class yesterday I alluded to an argument due to Michael Smith. The argument, recall, was meant to show that no mental state could have both <em>world to mind</em> and <em>mind to world</em> directions of fit. For those of you who are curious, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2253760">this is the paper</a> I had in mind.</p>

<p>Here is a representative passage (p. 56):</p>

<p><blockquote><p>For, as we have understood the concept of direction of fit, the direction of fit of a state with the content that <em>p</em> is determined, <em>inter alia</em>, by its counterfactual dependence on a perception with the content that <em>not p</em>. A state with both directions of fit would therefore have to be such that <em>both</em>, in the presence of such a perception it tends to go out of existence, and, in the presence of such a perception, it tends to endure, disposing the subject that has it to bring it about that <em>p</em>. Taken quite literally, then, the idea that there may be a state with both directions of fit is just plain incoherent.</p><footer><strong>Michael Smith</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.jstor.org/stable/2253760'>'The Humean Theory of Motivation'</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>UPDATE: In answer to Matt's question: the passage is repeated <em>verbatim</em> on <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2015884/Smith.TMP.Ch4.pdf">Ch. 4</a> of <em>The Moral Problem</em> (p. 118).</p>
