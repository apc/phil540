    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>I have updated the <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/">reading schedule</a> for the rest of the semester. Please <a href="http://perezcarballo.org/phil540/readings/">take a look</a>, especially if you will be giving an in-class presentation (you will notice it differs a fair bit from the tentative schedule on the syllabus).</li>
<li>A final reminder to those of you taking this class for credit: you need to submit <em>three short response pieces</em> before the end of the semester. If you are writing on something we are reading for a given Tuesday, your response piece is due on the previous Sunday.</li>
<li>Also for those of you taking this class for credit: you should be thinking about scheduling a meeting with me to discuss your final paper. On the syllabus it is stated that this meeting should take place before March 31st. Since I had miscalculated when Spring break was going to be, I have decided to move that date forward until April 2.</li>
</ul>


<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

    <id>http://apc.github.com/phil540/blog/2013/02/15/back-in-business</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Next week, we will be open for business as usual. I will get in touch with all of you soon to start thinking about make up sessions.</p>

<p>For now, let us pick up where we left. I want to use the first third of the meeting (or so) to wrap up our discussion of Lewis on Desire as Belief. Please take a moment to look at <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2254563">the sequel</a>, especially if you haven't yet.</p>

<p>But the bulk of our discussion will revolve around <a href="http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/019824908X.001.0001/acprof-9780198249085-chapter-6">Chapter 6</a> of <em>Reasons and Persons</em>.</p>

<p>(Note: There is a typo in the syllabus, I will fix it when I'm back in LA. The reading is <em>not</em> chapter 1, but chapter 6.)</p>
